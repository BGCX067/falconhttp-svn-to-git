#summary Howto run it?
#labels compile,run

= Introduction =

It should be very easy to get it running. As it was developed using eclipse CDT, all you need is:
-eclipse (used version: Galileo)
-CDT plugin (take the CDT+Eclipse bundle from the eclipse download site)
-SVN plugin (e.g. Subclipse)

The SVN should contain the whole project configuration to import it directliy into eclipse.
Adapt the run-configuration and change some parameters in the server.config file, and it should work.

Easy... Isn't it?

= Details =

If you want to compile it outside eclipse:
remember that gcc to compile it with threads needs the -pthread flag
whole compilestring
gcc -lpthread -lrt -lgcc_s -o"WebServer" ...

Btw: The server was implemented on Ubuntu Linux, so if you use another operating system some of the functionality may not work.
